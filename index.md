### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4 Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-kush-thomas-2/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was a cool little game that we coded that can be played between 2 players. During the lab, we used the if and else functions to code the game. Even though it was a simple code and a simple game, making the game was the best part, and being able to play it with other people makes it fun too.

* [Lab 5 Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-kush-christian/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 5, part 2 was also another one of my favorite labs because, like lab 4, part 2, it was another type of game. I would play games like blackjack obviously with fake money online and being able to create my own version of the game made it even more cool. Although it was a little more challenging than the Hi-Lo game, it wasnâ€™t impossible. We were able to implement boolean operators and saw how much easier it was to use those rather than making another statement.

* [Lab 9 Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-kush-and-jiayi/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 9, part 2 was my third favorite lab because I would always play games when I was younger, and being able to use input and output files made me realize how much coding it actually took for developers to save our data and boot it back up when we want. Although it was a bit different than the Hi-Lo game, it was still similar and we had an idea of what to do. This was one of the few labs where we used input and output files, but knowing how to execute them properly was cool.
